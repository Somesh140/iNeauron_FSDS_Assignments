        "\n",
        "Q2. Greedy versus non-greedy makes a difference when there are multiple possible matches within the input string. Greedy matching will try to match as much as possible, potentially consuming parts that could have been matched by subsequent patterns. In contrast, non-greedy matching will try to match as little as possible, allowing subsequent patterns to match more content.\n",

A scenario where using a non-tagged category would have a significant impact on the program's outcomes is when you need to group multiple elements together but do not want to capture them for further processing. Non-tagged groups can be useful in such cases to improve the organization and readability of the pattern while avoiding unnecessary capturing of groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. The situation where a look-ahead condition not consuming characters could make a difference in the program's results is when you want to match a pattern based on the presence or absence of certain characters, but you don't want those characters to be included in the matched result. This can be useful for assertions or validations without affecting the actual content being matched.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q7. The benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression is improved code readability and maintainability. When using named groups, the pattern becomes self-descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each captured group. Additionally, if the order of the groups changes, the code using named groups remains unaffected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. Yes, you can identify repeated items within a target string using named groups. For example, in the string \"The cow jumped over the moon\", you can use the pattern `(?P<word>\\b\\w+\\b).*\\b(?P=word)\\b` to match and identify any repeated word in the string.\n",

It automatically handles the iteration over the string, skipping delimiters, and returning the next token. In contrast, the `re.findall` feature returns all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in a string without any tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. No, a scanner object does not have to be named \"scanner.\" You can choose any valid variable name according to the naming conventions of the programming language you are using. The name \"scanner\" is commonly used to convey the purpose of the object, but it is not a requirement."
