        "Q1. Text files and binary files differ in how they store and represent data. Text files store data as human-readable characters using a specific character encoding, such as ASCII or UTF-8. The contents of a text file can be viewed and edited using a text editor. On the other hand, binary files store data in a format that is not directly human-readable. They contain sequences of bytes that can represent various types of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or complex data structures. Binary files require specialized software or algorithms to interpret and manipulate their contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Using text files is a better option in scenarios where the data needs to be human-readable or easily editable. Text files are suitable for storing textual data, configuration files, logs, or documents. They can be opened and modified using simple text editors. Binary files are preferred when the data is structured in a specific binary format or when it requires efficient storage and processing. Binary files are commonly used for storing images, audio, video, or complex data structures where the exact representation of the data is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. One issue with using binary operations to directly read and write Python integers to disk is that it can lead to compatibility issues across different systems or platforms. The byte order (endianess) of integers can vary between systems, causing problems when reading or writing binary data. Another issue is that the size of an integer may vary depending on the platform or the Python version being used, which can result in compatibility issues when trying to read or write integers using a different system or Python version.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Using the `with` keyword in Python when working with files provides a benefit of automatic resource management. When a file is opened using the `with` statement, Python guarantees that the file will be properly closed after the block of code within the `with` statement is executed, even if an exception occurs. This ensures that system resources associated with the file, such as file handles, are released correctly, preventing resource leaks and improving code readability and robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. When reading a line of text in Python, the trailing newline character is included in the returned string. However, when writing a line of text using the `write()` method, Python does not append a newline character automatically. It is the responsibility of the programmer to explicitly include the newline character (\"\\n\") if desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Random-access operations, which allow reading or writing data at any specific position within a file, are enabled by the `seek()` and `tell()` file operations in Python. The `seek(offset, whence)` method sets the file's current position to the given offset, relative to the reference point specified by `whence`. The `tell()` method returns the current position of the file pointer. These operations are useful when there is a need to read or modify data at non-sequential locations within a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. The `struct` package in Python is most commonly used when dealing with binary data that follows a specific format or structure. It provides functions to pack and unpack data into/from binary strings according to a specified format. The `struct` package is useful for tasks such as parsing binary file formats, network protocols, or working with low-level binary data representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. Pickling is the best option when there is a need to serialize and store complex Python objects in a binary format. Pickling allows objects to be serialized and later deserialized, preserving their state and structure. It is useful for tasks such as object persistence, inter-process communication, or caching complex data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. The `shelve` package in Python is best used when there is a need to store and retrieve Python objects in a simple key-value database-like format. `shelve` provides a dictionary-like interface for storing objects, where the keys can\n",
        "\n",
        " be strings and the values can be arbitrary Python objects. It is useful when there is a requirement to persistently store and retrieve objects without the need for a full-fledged database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. One special restriction when using the `shelve` package is that the keys must be strings. Unlike regular Python dictionaries, which allow various types of keys, `shelve` requires string keys. This is because `shelve` uses a underlying database library that typically only supports string keys. Therefore, if keys of other types need to be stored, they must be converted to strings before being used as keys in a `shelve` database."
