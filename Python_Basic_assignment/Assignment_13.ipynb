        "1. RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha, where each component value represents the intensity of the respective color and the alpha value represents the opacity/transparency of the color.\n",
        "2. To get the RGBA value of an image using the Pillow module, you can use the `getpixel()` method of the Image object. For example: \n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from PIL import Image\n",

        "3. A box tuple is a tuple containing four integers representing the left, upper, right, and lower pixel coordinates of a rectangular region in an image. The format of the box tuple is `(left, upper, right, lower)`. For example, to crop an image to a rectangular region defined by a box tuple, you can use the `crop()` method of the Image object as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Open image\n",
        "   image = Image.open('image.png')\n",

        "   box = (0, 0, 50, 50)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Crop the image to the rectangular region defined by the box tuple\n",
        "   cropped_image = image.crop(box)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. To get the width and height of an Image object, you can use the `size` attribute of the Image object. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Open image\n",
        "   image = Image.open('image.png')\n",

        "   width, height = image.size\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. To get an Image object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can first crop the original image using a box tuple, and then resize the resulting image to 100x100 using the `resize()` method of the Image object. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Open image\n",
        "   image = Image.open('image.png')\n",

        "   \n",
        "   # Resize the resulting image to 100x100\n",
        "   resized_image = cropped_image.resize((100, 100))\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "6. To save changes made to an Image object as an image file, you can use the `save()` method of the Image object. The first argument to the `save()` method is the filename to save the image as. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Open image\n",
        "   image = Image.open('image.png')\n",

        "   # Save the modified image as a new file\n",
        "   image.save('modified_image.png')\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "7. The `ImageDraw` module contains Pillow's shape-drawing code. To draw shapes on an Image object using Pillow, you first need to create an `ImageDraw.Draw` object from the Image object, and then use the methods of the `ImageDraw.Draw` object to draw shapes. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "   draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Draw a red rectangle on the image\n",
        "   draw.rectangle((x1, y1, x2, y2), fill=(255, 0, 0))\n",
        "   \n",
